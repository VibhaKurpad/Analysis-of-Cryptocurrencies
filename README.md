## AIM
Our aim is to conduct a thorough analysis of cryptocurrencies. From a technical point of view as well as from a financial and social point of view.
We have studied the impacts of various Global events on Bitcoin prices. We have found that the very recent global pandemic has had an impact on 
Bitcoin prices. Prices dropped as many people started liquidating their assets. In our report an evident spike is seen between
mid 2017 to 2018 .Prices soared by a whopping 1,813 percent . What caused this sudden spike ? A whale .According to research a single whale â€“ which is 
someone who holds large quantities of bitcoins , was behind the iconic rise . We also explored techniques to predict Bitcoin prices. The techniques 
explored were Simple Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing as well as ARIMA models. Amongst all 3, the ARIMA model gave the best results.
